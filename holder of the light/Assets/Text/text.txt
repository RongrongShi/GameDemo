Maybe you also know that the space are jump?⚆_⚆ If you press twice, magical things will happen, such as double jump or something.
Ok, I know it looks weird. But don't close the game yet.ಥ_ಥ
Press the shift key, I know you use it a lot ( ᐛ ) you know what that means. 
Ah, you ask me what are you going to do? Just read my annoying text and go on an adventure. 
Who I am?
